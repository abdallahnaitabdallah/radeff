Backend (Django REST Framework)
The backend provides the API for managing users, service requests, and providers.
The api app contains the necessary endpoints, serializers, and views.

Frontend (React.js)
The React.js frontend includes components for user registration, login, request creation, and request tracking.
It communicates with the backend API to retrieve and update data.

Mobile App (React Native)
The React Native mobile app offers a seamless user experience for both service requesters and providers.
It leverages native device features while interacting with the backend API for data synchronization.
